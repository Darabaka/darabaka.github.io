    <p>
        <a href="./padoru">This song</a> have been known to turn anyone that
        listens to it into a brainless beast that prey on other people's sense
        of hearing. There have been several cases a disappearance which have
        been linked to this song but only around the end of the last month of
        the year.

        So please, whatever happens, do use that song for science and finding a
        way to save those lost beasts but do not, under any circumstances,
        send this song to someone without this warning.
